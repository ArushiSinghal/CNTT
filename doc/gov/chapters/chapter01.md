## 1.1 WHo We Are

Soon thereafter, additional participants began to steadily joined the Task Force. It reached its first major milestone of gaining the sponsorship and support of GSMA and The Linux Foundation- Networking in Summer 2019, and it continues to grow steadily. CNTT now has over thirty network operators and vendor partners (VNF suppliers, third-party integrators, hw/sw suppliers) in its member commmunity and are leading the industry in creating a common Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure in the form of reference model and architecture definitions, as well as reference implementations and certifications. 

The CNTT organizational processes and procedures provided in this document were undertaken by a CNTT working group and developed under the guidnce of the CNTT Governance Steering Committee to address CNTT's ability to scale, garner momentum, and plan for the future of CNTT--as outlined in our 3rd Technical Workshop in Antwerp, Belgium, in September 2019.
